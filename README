Updated to use Maven.
After pulling the project, run mvn gae:unpack so as to download Google App SDK.
Warning, this should be done only once, when recovering the project.

Then, just launch: mvn gae:run to test localy. Please note that on Unix based systems, you'll perhaps need to launch it as root through something like sudo mvn gae:run.
For deploying the project, just launch mvn gae:deploy.

Tested on MacOSX localy, the project was working fine ;)
